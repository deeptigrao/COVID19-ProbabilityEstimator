# COVID19-ProbabilityEstimator
COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease that originated from Hubei province being Wuhan as the central outbreak point.
This project proposes a model where the probability of getting infected will be derived from the person's symptoms.
The prediction is very much required to understand the interdependencies of the category of symptoms responsible for infection.
Used various algorithms for classification and performance metrics of those were compared and sucessful method was implemented.
The approximate mean accuracy score using these algorithms was found to be 78%.
